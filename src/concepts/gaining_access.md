# Accessing Telemetry data

Access to telemetry data is limited to two groups:

1. Mozilla employees and contractors
2. Contributors who have signed a [non-disclosure agreement](https://wiki.mozilla.org/NDA),
   have a sustained track record of contribution, and have a demonstrated need to access this data

If you are an employee or contractor, you should already have the necessary permissions.

If you are a contributor and want to request access to Firefox Telemetry data, [file a bug in the operations component](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Data%20Platform%20and%20Tools&component=Operations)
and ask an established Mozilla contributor or employee to vouch for you.
